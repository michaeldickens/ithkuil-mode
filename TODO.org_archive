- Have a generalized function that can parse a partial or complete formative (in decoded form) into an internal representation
- Functions to modify formative can use this parser to read in a formative, change it, then write it back out

* DONE Parser implementation is really janky. Would be much cleaner with regexes. Parser generator would be even better
